[Operon the company](http://operon.systems/) is led by highly experienced team of health informaticians from varying backgrounds. To find out more about the team, just [click here](http://operon.systems/our-team/).

The Operon platform -based service allows developers to build health apps easily on a standard clinical data repository (CDR) and vendor-neutral archive (VNA) for unstructured data.

The cloud-hosted implementation is based on the openEHR and IHE-XDS standards and uses an implementation already proven at scale . The platform  provides access to a library of openEHR archetypes, the building blocks of EHR systems, and a powerful set of functions accessible via an easy to use REST API supporting H7L FHIR.  This allows interoperable applications to be built 10-100 times faster than by traditional methods of development.

Basic access to the platform is free, and this is type of access offers sufficient resources to support the development of a small, relatively lightweight application.

In addition to the free tier, Operon offers a flexible range of paid for tariffs to support individuals, teams and organisations.
