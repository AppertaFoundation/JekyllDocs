The Operon platform-based service allows developers to build health apps easily on a standard clinical data repository (CDR) and vendor-neutral archive (VNA) for unstructured data.

The cloud-hosted implementation is based on the openEHR and IHE-XDS standards and uses an implementation already proven at scale . The platform  provides access to a library of openEHR archetypes, the building blocks of EHR systems, and a powerful set of functions accessible via an easy to use REST API supporting H7L FHIR.  This allows interoperable applications to be built 10-100 times faster than by traditional methods of development.

To find out more about the concepts and rationale for the open platform approach, you may want to look at the video below.
