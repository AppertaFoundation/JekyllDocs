## Overview
The Models function allows you to manage the templates and archetypes used in your Clinical Data Repository. You can import new templates (which will automatically import the associated archetypes), delete templates which are no longer required and view the content of existing templates and archetypes.

You can access the Model function by clicking on the Models button (2) in the top menu.
