## Introduction

The Operon Cloud provides a secure open platform that enables you to build interoperable apps for health and social care.

Our platform provides the plumbing and takes care of much of the "heavy lifting" allowing you to concentrate your efforts on application functionality while the platform deals with issues including interoperability, cyber-security, information governance and business continuity.

Unlike many other platforms which are based on proprietary approaches which mean your application is locked-in to the platform the Operon Cloud uses established open standards including openEHR, IHE-XDS, FHIR and SMART which means you applications are easily transportable to other platforms based on these standards.

To find out more about the rationale and concepts behind the open platform approach, you may want to look this video.

## Explore the API

All interaction with the Operon Cloud is through a set of REST APIs that are provisioned for you when you create an Operino. The easiest way to understand how these APIs work and the services they provide is to read the documentation and explore the APIs using Postman which provides a test harness allowing you to experiment with the APIs available in your Operinos.  

## Connect you First Application

Once you understand the basics you will be ready to connect your first application to the Operon Cloud. You can build applications to run on the Operon Cloud using virtually any web development language of your choice.
